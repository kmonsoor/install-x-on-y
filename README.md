# Install X on Y

When I was first learning object methods, I spent a lot of time digging through the docs to find the appropriate one, and I had to search one by one. I made this resource to help people find the correct object method a bit more naturally. You can narrow down what you want to do and explore until you find what's most useful to you.

Bootstrapped from https://github.com/sdras/object-explore/

I realize that there are about a million ways that this resource can be set up, and some of the taxonomy is necessarily opinionated. I tried to focus on what I thought would have helped me learn the best, rather than industry standard delineations. If that style of learning suits you better, that's great! This resource is not set up that way. Please keep in mind that this is not meant to be as comprehensive or a replacement for full documentation, which is why the MDN docs are linked to in each method.

            
**Enjoy!**


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# to build for the docs:
npm run build
# then rename `dist` to `docs` and remove the first slash `/static` from `static` in `index.html`
# then change the font paths in the css file from `/static` to `../../static`
```
